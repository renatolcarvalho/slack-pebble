# slack-pebble
Example of Pebble Watch Development with Slack API

Consumer application at the service of Slack API to demonstrate the development of the Pebble Watch. Used to Pebble.js library.

When using you must put the Token generated from Slack in the application of variable.

If someone want to create the configuration file for adding the token would be very cool.
